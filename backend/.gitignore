This .gitignore file includes rules for ignoring node_modules directories for both frontend and backend, environment configuration files, build artifacts for both frontend and backend, logs, and a data directory for MongoDB.

You can place this combined .gitignore file in the root of your MERN stack project repository, and it should help you manage common ignored files and directories for both the frontend and backend parts of your project. Make sure to adjust it further based on your specific project structure and any other files or directories that need to be ignored.
